there are weird bits to vanilla javascript, that influence how later usages of say typescript in angular work, so this is a playground of sorts to explore those elements, specifically related to js.

1. callbacks
    - how asyncronous coding changed over the years in js, and why ([good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB-OmN1egV8))
1. importing
    - import, require, and 'in-html'... and possibly other tooling (bower? gulp?)
1. oop 
    - --> 'classes' in js, the 'new' keyword, and chaining with 'this'. -- all in one bonanza!
